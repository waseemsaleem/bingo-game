# Project Overview

This project was bootstrapped with React (Typescript)

- Designed project structure from scratch.
- Covered video attached in requirement document and basic rules
- Analyzed json-examples folder + examples of data sets inside the tests folder and developed APIs accordingly
-	The assignment is completed using Typescript, React and basic coding principles;

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

To start the app in dev mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run test`

Run the test cases.

## Improvments can be done if you require it and give me separate time to do these

- Better styling and layout.
- Unit testing using cypress, jest testing tools
- I tried to complete SRS implementation as per SDLC process. if I would be part of a team, quality of this module (assignment) will be more better. because you know, Team work is always more effient than individual.
- It can be deployed on any cloud (azure, aws or gcp)
- We can implement authentiation and authorization for APIs e.i. JWT token implementation
